# 11. NP-Complete Problems

**This is a work in progress, we will get there sooner or later.**


- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Given a set of cities, determine the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin. Although NP-hard, approximate or heuristic solutions are commonly employed in competitions.

- **Clique, Vertex Cover, and Subset Sum**: These are classical NP-complete problems, and while exact solutions are impractical for large instances, small versions or approximation algorithms often appear.
