# 2. C++ Competitive Programming Hacks

In this section, we'll cover essential tips and tricks that will help you improve your efficiency and performance in competitive programming using C++. From mastering typing speed to reducing code verbosity and handling complexity, each aspect plays a crucial role in gaining a competitive edge.

C++ is known for its speed and flexibility, but using it effectively requires a deep understanding of both the language and the common pitfalls that arise in competitive programmings. The goal here is to help you streamline your coding process, minimize errors, and ensure that your solutions run as efficiently as possible.

We'll break down these tips into the following areas:

- **Typing Efficiency**: How to type faster and more accurately, which can save you valuable time during competitive programming.
- **Code Reduction Techniques**: Ways to reduce code size without sacrificing clarity or correctness, using C++ features like the Standard Template Library (STL).
- **Managing Complexity**: Strategies to handle the time and space complexity of algorithms, ensuring that your solutions scale efficiently with larger inputs.

By applying these hacks, you'll be better equipped to tackle the challenges of competitive programming with C++ and improve your overall performance. Keep in mind that the code and techniques discussed here are optimized specifically for competitive programming environments, where the code is written for single-use and will not be maintained or reused. These approaches may not be suitable for professional development, where code readability, maintainability, and long-term reliability are critical.

## 2.1 Typing Tips

If you don’t type quickly, **you should invest at least two hours per week** on the website: [https://www.speedcoder.net](https://www.speedcoder.net). Once you have completed the basic course, select the C++ lessons and practice regularly. Time is crucial in competitive programming, and slow typing can be disastrous.

To expand on this, efficient typing isn’t just about speed; it’s about reducing errors and maintaining a steady flow of code. When you're in a competitive programming, every second matters. Correcting frequent typos or having to look at your keyboard will significantly slow down your progress. Touch typing—knowing the layout of the keyboard and typing without looking—becomes a vital skill.

## 2.2 Why Typing Speed Matters

In a typical programming competitive programming, you’ll have to solve several problems within a fixed time frame. Faster typing allows you to focus more on problem-solving rather than struggling to input the code. However, typing speed without accuracy is meaningless. **Accurate and fast typing** ensures that once you have the solution, you can implement it efficiently.

Typing slow or with many errors leads to:

- Lost time correcting mistakes
- Distractions from your problem-solving process
- Higher risk of failing to complete solutions on time

You should aim for a **typing speed** of at least 60 words per minute (WPM) with high accuracy. On platforms like [https://www.speedcoder.net](https://www.speedcoder.net), you can practice typing specific code syntax, which is more effective for programmers compared to general typing lessons. For example, learning C++ or Python shortcuts helps improve your typing speed in actual coding scenarios.

\begin{align*}
\text{Time spent fixing errors} + \text{Time lost from slow typing} \\
= \text{Lower overall performance in competitive programming}
\end{align*}
$$

## 2.3 Advanced Typing Techniques for Programmers

Here are some additional tips to improve your typing for competitive programming:

1. **Use IDE shortcuts:** 1. **Use IDE shortcuts:** Learn keyboard shortcuts for your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Navigating and editing code using shortcuts reduces time spent moving between mouse and keyboard. In the case of [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) contests, the IDE provided will typically be [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/helios/sr2/eclipse-ide-cc-developers), so it's crucial to familiarize yourself with its shortcuts and navigation to maximize efficiency during the competitive programming. However, it's important to note that the choice of IDE may change, and contestants should always check the specific rules and environments for each competition.
2. **Focus on frequent patterns:** As you practice, focus on typing patterns you use frequently, such as loops, if-else conditions, and function declarations. Automating these patterns in your muscle memory will save valuable time.
3. **Practice algorithm templates:** Some problems require similar algorithms, such as dynamic programming, sorting, or tree traversal. By practicing typing these algorithms regularly, you'll be able to quickly implement them during competitive programmings.

In competitive programming, every second counts, and being proficient with your typing can give you a significant advantage.

## 2.4 Typing Less in Competitive Programming

In competitive programming, time is a critical resource. Therefore, optimizing typing speed and avoiding repetitive code can make a significant difference. Below, we will discuss strategies to minimize typing when working with `std::vector` during competitive programmings, where access to the internet or pre-prepared code snippets may be restricted.

### 2.4.1. Using `#define` for `std::vector` Abbreviations

We can use `#define` to create short aliases for common vector types. This is particularly useful when you need to declare multiple vectors throughout the code.

```cpp
#define VI std::vector<int>
#define VVI std::vector<std::vector<int>>
#define VS std::vector<std::string>
```

With these definitions, declaring vectors becomes much faster:

```cpp
VI numbers;  // std::vector<int> numbers;
VVI matrix;  // std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix;
VS words;    // std::vector<std::string> words;
```

However, it's important to note that in larger, professional projects, using `#define` for type aliases is generally discouraged because it does not respect C++ scoping rules and can lead to unexpected behavior during debugging. In competitive programming, where speed is essential, this technique can be useful, but it should be avoided in long-term or collaborative codebases.

### 2.4.2. Predefined Utility Functions

Another effective strategy is to define utility functions that you can reuse for common vector operations, such as reading from input, printing, or performing operations like sorting or summing elements.

**Reading Vectors**:

```cpp
#define FAST_IO std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(nullptr);

void read_vector(VI& vec, int n) {
    if (n > 0) vec.reserve(static_cast<size_t>(n));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        vec.push_back(x);
    }
}
```

With the `read_vector` function, you can quickly read a vector of `n` elements:

```cpp
FAST_IO

VI numbers;
read_vector(numbers, n);
```

**Printing Vectors**:

```cpp
void print_vector(const VI& vec) {
    for (const int& x : vec) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
}
```

This function allows you to easily print the contents of a vector:

```cpp
print_vector(numbers);
```

### 2.4.3. Predefining Common Operations

If you know that certain operations, such as sorting or summing elements, are frequent in a competitive programming, consider defining these operations at the beginning of the code.

**Sorting Vectors**:

```cpp
#define SORT_VECTOR(vec) std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end())
```

You can then sort any vector quickly:

```cpp
SORT_VECTOR(numbers);
```

**Summing Elements**:

```cpp
int sum_vector(const VI& vec) {
    return std::accumulate(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 0);
}
```

To calculate the sum of a vector's elements:

```cpp
int total = sum_vector(numbers);
```

### 2.4.4. Using Lambda Functions

In C++11 and later versions, lambda functions can be a quick and concise way to define operations inline for vectors:

```cpp
auto print_square = [](const VI& vec) {
    for (int x : vec) {
        std::cout << x * x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
};
```

These inline functions can be defined and used without the need to write complete functions:

```cpp
print_square(numbers);
```

_While lambda functions can be very useful for quick, one-off operations, it's important to note that excessive use of lambdas, especially complex ones, can make code harder to read and maintain. In competitive programming, where code clarity might be sacrificed for speed, this may be less of a concern. However, it's a good practice to be mindful of code readability, especially when debugging complex algorithms_.

### 2.4.5 Prefer Not to Use `#define`

Another way to reduce typing time is by using `typedef` or `using` to create abbreviations for frequently used vector types:

```cpp
typedef std::vector<int> VI;
typedef std::vector<std::vector<int>> VVI;
using VS = std::vector<std::string>;
```

In many cases, the use of `#define` can be replaced with more modern and safe C++ constructs like `using`, `typedef`, or `constexpr`. `#define` does not respect scoping rules and does not offer type checking, which can lead to unintended behavior. Using `typedef` or `using` provides better type safety and integrates smoothly with the C++ type system, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.

1. **Replacing `#define` with Type Aliases**

   For example:

   ```cpp
   #define VI std::vector<int>
   #define VVI std::vector<std::vector<int>>
   #define VS std::vector<std::string>
   ```

   Can be replaced with `using` or `typedef` to create type aliases:

   ```cpp
   using VI = std::vector<int>;
   using VVI = std::vector<std::vector<int>>;
   using VS = std::vector<std::string>;

   // Or using typedef (more common in C++98/C++03)
   typedef std::vector<int> VI;
   typedef std::vector<std::vector<int>> VVI;
   typedef std::vector<std::string> VS;
   ```

   **`using` and `typedef` are preferred because they respect C++ scoping rules and offer better support for debugging, making the code more secure and readable**.

2. **Replacing `#define` with Constants**

3. **Using `constexpr` in Functions**

   If you have macros that perform calculations, you can replace them with `constexpr` functions:

   Example:

   ```cpp
   #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
   ```

   Can be replaced with:

   ```cpp
   constexpr int square(int x) {
       return x * x;
   }
   ```

   **`constexpr` functions provide type safety, avoid unexpected side effects, and allow the compiler to evaluate the expression at compile-time, resulting in more efficient and safer code**.

For competitive programming, using `#define` might seem like the fastest way to reduce typing and speed up coding. However, using `typedef` or `using` is generally more efficient because it avoids potential issues with macros and integrates better with the compiler. **While reducing variable names or abbreviating functions might save time during a competitive programming, remember that in professional code, clarity and maintainability are far more important**. Therefore, avoid using shortened names and unsafe constructs like `#define` in production code, libraries, or larger projects.

## 3. Optimizing File I/O in C++ for competitive programmings

In many competitive programming contests, especially those involving large datasets, the program is required to read input from a file that can be very large. For this reason, it is crucial to optimize how files are read. Efficient file handling can make the difference between a solution that completes within the time limits and one that does not. Implementing techniques to speed up file I/O is indispensable for handling such cases effectively.

### 3.1 Disabling I/O Synchronization

To improve the performance of input/output (I/O) operations, we disable the synchronization between the standard C and C++ I/O libraries:

```cpp
std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
std::cin.tie(nullptr);
```

- The function `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` disables the synchronization of the C++ streams with the C streams, allowing the program to perform I/O operations more quickly.
- `std::cin.tie(nullptr)` detaches the input stream (`std::cin`) from the output stream (`std::cout`), preventing automatic flushes that can cause delays.

When we disable synchronization with `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);`, the program benefits from better performance in I/O operations since it no longer needs to synchronize the C++ input/output functions (`std::cin`, `std::cout`) with the C functions (`scanf`, `printf`).

This synchronization, when enabled, introduces overhead because the system ensures that both libraries can be used simultaneously without conflict. By removing this synchronization, we eliminate that overhead, allowing I/O operations to be processed more directly and faster.

This optimization is particularly beneficial in programs that perform a large number of read and write operations, such as when processing large amounts of data from files. Additionally, by using `std::cin.tie(nullptr);`, we prevent `std::cout` from being automatically flushed before each input operation, avoiding another form of latency that could impact performance in I/O-heavy contexts.

### 3.2 Command Line Argument Checking

Before proceeding with execution, the code checks if exactly one argument was passed through the command line, which represents the name of the file to be read:

```cpp
if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <file_name>\n";
    return 1;
}
```

- `argc` is the number of arguments passed to the program, including the name of the executable.
- `argv` is an array of strings containing the arguments.
- If the number of arguments is not 2, the program prints an error message and exits with `return 1`, indicating failure.

### 3.3 Opening and Verifying the File

The code attempts to open the specified file and checks whether the opening was successful:

```cpp
std::ifstream file(argv[1]);
if (!file) {
    std::cerr << "Error opening file: " << argv[1] << "\n";
    return 1;
}
```

- `std::ifstream file(argv[1]);` attempts to open the file for reading.
- If `file` is not in a valid state (i.e., the file couldn't be opened), an error message is displayed, and the program terminates.

While good practice in general software development, is usually unnecessary in competitive programming contests. Instead, you can often assume the file exists and start reading from it directly. This saves valuable coding time and simplifies your solution.
