# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Knapsack Problem

Select items to maximize a total value without exceeding a capacity. Variations include 0/1 Knapsack, fractional knapsack, and bounded knapsack.

## Longest Increasing Subsequence

Find the longest subsequence of a sequence where the elements are in increasing order. The time complexity can be reduced to $O(n \log n)$ using binary search in combination with dynamic programming.

## Grid Pathfinding

DP-based grid traversal problems, such as finding the minimum or maximum cost path from one corner of a grid to another, often appear.
