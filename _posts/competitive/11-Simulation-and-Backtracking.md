# 10. Simulation and Backtracking


**This is a work in progress, we will get there sooner or later.**


- **Simulation Problems**: Involve modeling the behavior of a system over time, often requiring careful handling of edge cases and efficiency in handling large inputs.

- **Backtracking**: Used for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku, N-Queens, and other combinatorial puzzles by trying possible solutions recursively.
