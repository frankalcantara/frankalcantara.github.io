# 5. Graphs and Graph Theory

**Range Minimum Queries (RMQ)**

Data structure to find the minimum in any range in $O(1)$ after $O(n \log n)$ preprocessing.

[text](https://contest.cs.cmu.edu/295/s20/tutorials/lca.mark)

- Algorithm: Sparse Table for RMQ

- **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Basic graph traversal algorithms, often used to explore nodes or determine connectivity in graphs.

- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Problems where the goal is to find a subset of the edges that connects all vertices in a weighted graph while minimizing the total edge weight (Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms).

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Algorithms such as Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall are used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

- **Maximum Flow**: Problems involving optimizing flow through a network, such as Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp algorithms.

- **Strongly Connected Components**: Identifying maximal strongly connected subgraphs in directed graphs using algorithms like Kosaraju or Tarjan’s.
