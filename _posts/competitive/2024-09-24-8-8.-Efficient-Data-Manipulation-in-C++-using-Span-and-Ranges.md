# 8. Efficient Data Manipulation in C++ using Span and Ranges

In the fast-paced world of competitive programming and high-performance computing, efficient data manipulation is paramount. C++20 introduces two powerful features - `std::span` and `std::ranges` for that.

These features are particularly important because they address common performance bottlenecks in data-intensive applications. `std::span` provides a lightweight, non-owning view into contiguous data, reducing unnecessary copying and allowing for flexible, efficient data access. `std::ranges`, on the other hand, offers a unified, composable interface for working with sequences of data, enabling more intuitive and often more performant algorithm implementations. Together, they form a potent toolkit for developers seeking to push the boundaries of what's possible in terms of code efficiency and elegance in C++.

## 8.1 Using `std::span`

The `std::span` is a new feature introduced in C++20 that allows you to create lightweight, non-owning views of arrays and containers, such as `std::vector`. This avoids unnecessary copying of data and provides a flexible and efficient way to access and manipulate large blocks of data. `std::span` can be particularly useful when working with large datasets, file I/O, or when optimizing memory usage in competitive programming.

Unlike containers such as `std::vector`, `std::span` doesn't own the data it references. This means it doesn't allocate new memory and works directly with existing data, leading to lower memory overhead. Additionally, `std::span` can work with both static arrays and dynamic containers (like `std::vector`) without requiring copies. It provides safer array handling compared to raw pointers, as it encapsulates size information. Since `std::span` eliminates the need for memory copies, it can speed up operations where large datasets need to be processed in-place, or only certain views of data are required.

**Example of `std::span` for Efficient Data Access**:

In this example, we create a `std::span` from a `std::vector` of integers, allowing us to iterate over the vector’s elements without copying the data:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Create a vector of integers
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Create a span view of the vector
    std::span<int> view(numbers);

    // Iterate over the span and print the values
    for (int num : view) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**How `std::span` Works**:

$ \text{std::span<int> view(numbers);} $ creates a non-owning view of the `std::vector<int>` `numbers`. This allows access to the elements of the vector without copying them. The loop $ \text{for (int num : view)} $ iterates over the elements in the `std::span`, just like it would with the original `std::vector`, but with no additional overhead from copying the data.

### 8.1.1 Efficient Use Cases for `std::span`

`std::span` is especially useful when you want to work with sub-ranges of arrays or vectors. For example, when working with just part of a large dataset, you can use `std::span` to reference a subset without slicing or creating new containers:

```cpp
std::span<int> subrange = view.subspan(1, 3); // Access elements 1, 2, and 3
for (int num : subrange) {
    std::cout << num << " "; // Outputs: 2 3 4
}
```

When passing data to functions, `std::span` provides an efficient alternative to passing large vectors or arrays by reference. You can pass a span instead, ensuring that no copies are made, while maintaining full access to the original data:

```cpp
void process_data(std::span<int> data) {
    for (int num : data) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    process_data(numbers); // Pass the vector as a span
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the function `process_data` accepts a `std::span`, avoiding unnecessary copies and keeping the original data structure intact.

### 8.1.2 Comparing `std::span` to Traditional Methods

| Feature          | `std::vector`           | Raw Pointers          | `std::span`     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Memory Ownership | Yes                     | No                    | No              |
| Memory Overhead  | High (allocates memory) | Low                   | Low             |
| Bounds Safety    | High                    | Low                   | High            |
| Compatibility    | Works with STL          | Works with raw arrays | Works with both |

Unlike `std::vector`, which manages its own memory, `std::span` does not allocate or own memory. This is similar to raw pointers but with added safety since `std::span` knows its size. `std::span` is safer than raw pointers because it carries bounds information, helping avoid out-of-bounds errors. While raw pointers offer flexibility, they lack the safety features provided by modern C++.

### 8.1.3 Practical Application: Using `std::span` in Competitive Programming

When working with large datasets in competitive programming, using `std::span` avoids unnecessary memory copies, making operations faster and more efficient. You can easily pass sub-ranges of data to functions without creating temporary vectors or arrays. Additionally, it allows you to maintain full control over memory without introducing complex ownership semantics, as with `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`.

**Example: Efficiently Passing Data in a Competitive Programming Scenario**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>
#include <vector>

void solve(std::span<int> data) {
    for (int num : data) {
        std::cout << num * 2 << " "; // Example: print double each value
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> input = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500};

    // Use std::span to pass the entire vector without copying
    solve(input);

    // Use a subspan to pass only a portion of the vector
    solve(std::span<int>(input).subspan(1, 3)); // Pass elements 200, 300, 400

    return 0;
}
```

## 8.2 Efficient Data Manipulation with `std::ranges` in C++20

C++20 introduced the `<ranges>` library, which brings a powerful and flexible way to work with sequences of data through lazy-evaluated views and composable transformations. `std::ranges` allows you to create views over containers or arrays without modifying them or creating unnecessary copies. This is especially beneficial in competitive programming and high-performance applications, where minimizing both memory and computational overhead is crucial.

In traditional programming with containers like `std::vector`, iterating over and transforming data often requires intermediate storage or manual loops to handle operations like filtering, transforming, or slicing the data. With `std::ranges`, these operations can be composed in a clean and expressive way while maintaining optimal performance through lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation means that the transformations are only computed when the data is accessed, rather than immediately creating new containers or applying operations.

### 8.2.1 How `std::ranges` Works

The core idea behind `std::ranges` is to create "views" over data. These views allow you to manipulate and query data without modifying the underlying container. A view in `std::ranges` is an abstraction that can represent any sequence of elements that can be iterated over, just like a container. The key difference is that a view is not required to own its elements; instead, it provides a "window" into an existing data sequence, allowing for efficient operations.

**Example Filtering and Transforming Data with `std::ranges`**:

Suppose we have a vector of integers and we want to filter out the odd numbers and then multiply the remaining even numbers by two. Using traditional methods, we would need to loop through the vector, apply conditions, and store the results in a new container. With `std::ranges`, this can be done in a more expressive and efficient way:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ranges>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Create a lazy-evaluated view that filters out odd numbers and doubles the even ones
    auto even_doubled = numbers
                        | std::ranges::views::filter([](int n) { return n % 2 == 0; })
                        | std::ranges::views::transform([](int n) { return n * 2; });

    // Iterate over the view and print the results
    for (int num : even_doubled) {
        std::cout << num << " ";  // **Output**: 4 8 (only even numbers doubled)
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a view `even_doubled` over the original vector `numbers`. The first operation, `std::ranges::views::filter`, filters out all the odd numbers from the vector. The second operation, `std::ranges::views::transform`, multiplies each of the remaining even numbers by two. Both of these operations are lazily evaluated, meaning that no new container is created, and the transformations are applied only when iterating over the view. This approach is not only cleaner in terms of code but also more efficient in terms of performance.

### 8.2.2 Composition of Operations

One of the key strengths of `std::ranges` is its composability. Operations like filtering, transforming, or slicing can be composed together, and the result is still a view. This means that you can chain multiple operations together without needing intermediate containers or data structures. The result is a highly efficient pipeline of operations that is applied only when the data is accessed.

Consider the following example, where we filter, transform, and take only a part of the data:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ranges>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40};

    // Filter out numbers less than 20, double the remaining, and take only the first three
    auto result = numbers
                  | std::ranges::views::filter([](int n) { return n >= 20; })
                  | std::ranges::views::transform([](int n) { return n * 2; })
                  | std::ranges::views::take(3);

    // Iterate over the view and print the results
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";  // **Output**: 40 50 60
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we chain together three operations: filtering the numbers greater than or equal to 20, doubling them, and taking only the first three results. The operations are applied lazily and are only computed when iterating over the final view, `result`. This leads to highly efficient data processing, as no intermediate containers are created, and each transformation is performed only once for the relevant elements.

### 8.2.3 Memory and Performance Considerations

The key advantage of `std::ranges` is its use of lazy evaluation, which minimizes memory usage by avoiding the creation of temporary containers. In traditional methods, each operation (e.g., filtering or transforming) might create a new container, leading to increased memory consumption and computational overhead. With `std::ranges`, the operations are "stacked" and evaluated only when needed. This reduces the memory footprint and ensures that performance remains high, even when dealing with large datasets.

Another performance benefit comes from the fact that `std::ranges` operations are highly optimized. Since the operations are evaluated lazily and directly on the data, there's no need for unnecessary copying or allocation. This leads to more efficient cache usage and fewer CPU cycles spent on managing intermediate data structures.

### 8.2.3 Practical Use Cases in Competitive Programming

Imagine a scenario where you need to process only a portion of the input data based on certain conditions. Using traditional methods, this might involve creating multiple containers or applying multiple iterations over the data. With `std::ranges`, you can chain these operations in a single pass, improving both performance and code readability.

Consider the following example in a competitive programming context:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ranges>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5};

    // Sort the data, filter values greater than 15, and transform them by subtracting 5
    auto processed = data
                     | std::ranges::views::sort
                     | std::ranges::views::filter([](int n) { return n > 15; })
                     | std::ranges::views::transform([](int n) { return n - 5; });

    // Iterate and output the results
    for (int num : processed) {
        std::cout << num << " ";  // **Output**: 15 25 35 45
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the data is sorted, filtered, and transformed in a single efficient chain of operations. Each step is evaluated lazily, meaning that no intermediate containers or data copies are made, and each number is processed only once.

`std::ranges` in C++20 brings a powerful new way to work with data by providing efficient, lazy-evaluated views over containers. This minimizes memory usage, avoids unnecessary copying, and allows for highly optimized data processing pipelines. In competitive programming and high-performance applications, where every CPU cycle and byte of memory counts, using `std::ranges` can significantly improve both performance and code clarity. Whether you're filtering, transforming, or composing operations, `std::ranges` allows you to build complex data processing pipelines that are both expressive and efficient.
