# 8. Combinatorics and Counting

- **Permutations and Combinations**: Problems where the goal is to count or generate all possible arrangements or selections of elements.

- **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: Used for counting the number of elements in the union of several sets, especially when there are overlaps between sets.

- **Dynamic Counting Problems**: Counting the number of ways to reach a certain state or configuration, such as in grid traversal or combinatorial game problems.
