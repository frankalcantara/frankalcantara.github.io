# 9. String Processing

- **Pattern Matching**: Finding occurrences of a substring within a string, typically solved using algorithms like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) or the Z-algorithm.

- **String Hashing**: Allows for efficient comparison of substrings by computing hash values for each substring.

- **Trie Data Structures**: Used for efficiently storing and querying a large set of strings, especially useful in prefix-matching problems.
