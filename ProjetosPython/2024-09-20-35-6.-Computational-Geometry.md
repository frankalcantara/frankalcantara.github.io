# 6. Computational Geometry

- **Convex Hull**: Given a set of points, determine the smallest convex polygon that contains all points. Algorithms like Graham’s scan and Jarvis march solve this problem.

- **Intersection of Line Segments**: Problems that require determining whether line segments intersect, often solved with the sweep line algorithm.

- **Area and Distance Calculations**: Problems involving the calculation of polygon areas, distances between points, or other geometric properties.
