# Loops the heart of all competitive programming

Loops are, without a doubt, the most important part of any code, whether for competitive programming, high-performance applications, or even solving academic problems. Most programming languages offer more than one way to implement loops. In this text, since Python is only our pseudocode language, we will focus on studying loops in C++.

## Deep Dive into `for` Loops in Competitive Programming

C++ provides several ways to iterate over elements in a vector, using different types of `for` loops. In this section, we will explore the various `for` loop options available in C++20, discussing their performance and code-writing efficiency. We will also analyze which loops are best suited for competitive programming based on input size—whether dealing with small or large datasets.

### 1. `for` Loop with Iterator

The `for` loop using iterators is one of the most efficient ways to iterate over a vector, especially for complex operations where you need to manipulate the elements or the iterator’s position directly.

```cpp
for (auto it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it << " ";
}
```

Utilizing iterators directly avoids unnecessary function calls such as `operator[]` and allows fine-grained control over the iteration. Ideal when detailed control over the iterator is necessary or when iterating over containers that do not support direct index access (e.g., `std::list`).

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: This is a solid option as it allows precise control over the iteration with negligible overhead.
- **For Large Inputs**: Highly efficient due to minimal overhead and memory usage. However, ensure that the iterator’s operations do not induce cache misses, which can slow down performance for large datasets.

### 2. Classic `for` Loop with Index

The classic `for` loop using an index is efficient and provides precise control over the iteration process.

```cpp
for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
    std::cout << vec[i] << " ";
}
```

Accessing elements via index is fast, but re-evaluating `vec.size()` in each iteration can introduce a small overhead. Useful when you need to access or modify elements by their index or when you may need to adjust the index inside the loop.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: Efficient and straightforward, especially when the overhead of re-evaluating `vec.size()` is negligible.
- **For Large Inputs**: If performance is critical, store `vec.size()` in a separate variable before the loop to avoid repeated function calls, which can become significant for larger datasets.

### 3. Range-Based `for-each` with Constant Reference

Range-based `for-each` with constant reference is highly efficient for reading elements since it avoids unnecessary copies.

```cpp
for (const auto& elem : vec) {
    std::cout << elem << " ";
}
```

Using constant references avoids copying, making it very efficient for both memory and execution time. Recommended for reading elements when you don’t need to modify values or access their indices.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: Ideal for minimal syntax and efficient execution.
- **For Large Inputs**: Excellent choice due to the avoidance of element copies, ensuring optimal memory usage and performance.

### 4. Range-Based `for-each` by Value

The `for-each` loop can also iterate over elements by value, which is useful when you want to work with copies of the elements.

```cpp
for (auto elem : vec) {
    std::cout << elem << " ";
}
```

Elements are copied, which can reduce performance, especially for large data types. Useful when you need to modify a copy of the elements without affecting the original vector.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: Suitable when the overhead of copying is negligible, especially if you need to modify copies of elements.
- **For Large Inputs**: Avoid for large datasets or large element types, as the copying can lead to significant performance degradation.

### 5. `for` Loop with Range Views (C++20)

C++20 introduced `range views`, which allow iteration over subsets or transformations of elements in a container without creating copies.

```cpp
for (auto elem : vec | std::views::reverse) {
    std::cout << elem << " ";
}
```

Range views allow high-performance operations, processing only the necessary elements. Ideal for operations involving transformations, filtering, or iterating over subsets of elements.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: Works well, especially when applying transformations like reversing or filtering, while maintaining code readability.
- **For Large Inputs**: Very efficient as no extra memory is allocated, and the processing is done lazily, meaning only the required elements are accessed.

### 6. Parallel `for` Loop (C++17/C++20)

While not a traditional `for` loop, using parallelism in loops is a powerful feature introduced in C++17 and further enhanced in C++20.

```cpp
#include <execution>

std::for_each(std::execution::par, vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int& elem) {
elem \*= 2; // Parallelized operation
});
```

Uses multiple threads to process elements in parallel, offering substantial performance gains for intensive operations that can be performed independently on large datasets. It requires more setup and understanding of parallelism concepts but can provide significant performance boosts for operations on large datasets.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: Overkill. The overhead of managing threads and synchronization outweighs the benefits for small datasets.
- **For Large Inputs**: Extremely efficient. When dealing with large datasets, parallel processing can drastically reduce runtime, especially for computationally expensive operations.

### Optimal `for` Loops for Competitive Programming

Choosing the right type of `for` loop in competitive programming depends largely on input size and the specific use case. The following table summarizes the best choices for different scenarios:

| Input Size      | Best `for` Loop Option                                             | Reasoning                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small           | Range-Based `for-each` with Constant Reference                     | Offers minimal syntax, high readability, and avoids copies, making it fast and efficient.            |
| Small           | Classic `for` Loop with Index                                      | Provides precise control over the index, useful when index manipulation or modification is required. |
| Large           | Iterator-Based `for` Loop                                          | Highly efficient for large datasets due to minimal memory overhead and optimized performance.        |
| Large           | Parallel `for` Loop with `std::for_each` and `std::execution::par` | Ideal for computationally heavy tasks on large datasets, leveraging multiple threads to parallelize. |
| Transformations | `for` Loop with Range Views (C++20)                                | Ideal for processing subsets or transformations of data without creating extra copies.               |

## Now the `while` Loop which we all love

The `while` loop is another fundamental control structure in C++ that is often used in competitive programming. It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. In this section, we will explore the different use cases for `while` loops, their performance considerations, and scenarios where they may be preferable to `for` loops. We will also examine their application with both small and large datasets.

### 1. Basic `while` Loop

A `while` loop continues executing its block of code until the condition becomes false. This makes it ideal for situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < n) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

The `while` loop is simple and provides clear control over the loop's exit condition. The loop runs while `i < n`, and the iterator `i` is incremented manually within the loop. This offers flexibility in determining when and how the loop terminates.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: This structure is efficient, especially when the number of iterations is small and predictable.
- **For Large Inputs**: The `while` loop can be optimized for larger inputs by ensuring that the condition is simple to evaluate and that the incrementing logic doesn't introduce overhead.

### 2. `while` Loop with Complex Conditions

`while` loops are particularly useful when the condition for continuing the loop involves complex logic that cannot be easily expressed in a `for` loop.

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < n && someComplexCondition(i)) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

In this case, the loop runs not only based on the value of `i`, but also on the result of a more complex function. This makes `while` loops a good choice when the exit condition depends on multiple variables or non-trivial logic.

**Input Size Consideration**::

- **For Small Inputs**: This is ideal for small inputs where the condition can vary significantly during the iterations.
- **For Large Inputs**: Be cautious with complex conditions when dealing with large inputs, as evaluating the condition on every iteration may add performance overhead.

### 3. Infinite `while` Loops

An infinite `while` loop is a loop that runs indefinitely until an explicit `break` or `return` statement is encountered. This type of loop is typically used in scenarios where the termination condition depends on an external event, such as user input or reaching a specific solution.

```cpp
while (true) {
    // Process some data
    if (exitCondition()) break;
}
```

The loop runs until `exitCondition()` is met, at which point it breaks out of the loop. This structure is useful for algorithms that require indefinite running until a specific event happens.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: Generally unnecessary for small inputs unless the exit condition is based on dynamic factors.
- **For Large Inputs**: Useful for large inputs when the exact number of iterations is unknown, and the loop depends on a condition that could be influenced by the data itself.

### 4. `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once. This is useful when you need to run the loop at least one time regardless of the condition.

```cpp
int i = 0;
do {
    std::cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while (i < n);
```

In this case, the loop will print `i` at least once, even if `i` starts with a value that makes the condition false. This ensures that the loop runs at least one iteration.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: Ideal when you need to guarantee that the loop runs at least once, such as with small datasets where the minimum iteration is essential.
- **For Large Inputs**: Suitable for large datasets where the first iteration must occur independently of the condition.

### 5. `while` Loop with Early Exit

The `while` loop can be combined with early exit strategies using `break` or `return` statements to optimize performance, particularly when the loop can terminate before completing all iterations.

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < n) {
    if (shouldExitEarly(i)) break;
    std::cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

By including a condition inside the loop that checks for an early exit, you can significantly reduce runtime in cases where processing all elements is unnecessary.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: It can improve performance when early termination conditions are common or likely.
- **For Large Inputs**: Highly efficient for large datasets, particularly when the early exit condition is met frequently, saving unnecessary iterations.

### 6. Combining `while` with Multiple Conditions

A `while` loop can easily incorporate multiple conditions to create more complex termination criteria. This is particularly useful when multiple variables determine whether the loop should continue.

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < n && someOtherCondition()) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

This allows the loop to run based on multiple dynamic conditions, providing more control over the iteration process than a standard `for` loop might offer.

**Input Size Consideration**:

- **For Small Inputs**: A flexible option when the conditions governing the loop may change during execution, even for small datasets.
- **For Large Inputs**: Can be optimized for large datasets by ensuring that the condition checks are efficient and that unnecessary re-evaluations are minimized.

### Optimal `while` Loops for Competitive Programming

Choosing the right type of `while` loop depends on the nature of the input and the complexity of the condition. The following table summarizes the optimal choices for different input sizes:

| Input Size | Best `while` Loop Option                   | Reasoning                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small      | Basic `while` Loop                         | Offers straightforward control over iteration with minimal overhead and is easy to implement.                              |
| Small      | `do-while` Loop                            | Ensures at least one execution of the loop, which is crucial for cases where the first iteration is essential.             |
| Large      | `while` with Early Exit                    | Improves performance by terminating the loop early when a specific condition is met, saving unnecessary iterations.        |
| Large      | `while` with Complex Conditions            | Allows dynamic and flexible exit conditions, making it suitable for large datasets with evolving parameters.               |
| Continuous | Infinite `while` Loop with Explicit Breaks | Best for situations where the exact number of iterations is unknown and depends on external factors or dynamic conditions. |

## Special Loops in C++20 for Competitive Programming

In C++20, several advanced looping techniques have been introduced, each offering unique ways to improve code efficiency and readability. While some of these techniques provide remarkable performance optimizations, not all are well-suited for competitive programming. competitive programmings often involve handling dynamic inputs and generating outputs within strict time limits, so techniques relying heavily on compile-time computation are less practical. This section focuses on the most useful loop structures for competitive programmings, emphasizing runtime efficiency and adaptability to varying input sizes.

### 1. Range-Based Loops with `std::ranges::views`

C++20 introduces `ranges` and `views`, which allow you to create expressive and efficient loops by operating on views of containers without copying data. Views are lazily evaluated, meaning that operations like filtering, transformation, or reversing are applied only when accessed.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Using views to iterate in reverse
    for (auto elem : vec | std::views::reverse) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Benefits**:

Efficient and lazy evaluation ensures that operations like reversing or filtering are performed only when needed, rather than precomputing them or creating unnecessary copies of the data. This approach optimizes memory usage and speeds up execution, particularly when working with large datasets.

The syntax is also highly expressive and concise, allowing you to write clear and readable code. This is particularly useful when applying multiple transformations in sequence, as it helps maintain code simplicity while handling complex operations.

**Considerations for competitive programmings**:

Range views are particularly useful when working with large datasets, as they enable efficient processing by avoiding the creation of unnecessary copies and reducing memory overhead. This approach allows for smoother handling of extensive input data, improving overall performance.

Additionally, range views provide clarity and simplicity when dealing with complex operations. They streamline the process of transforming data, making it easier to apply multiple operations in a clean and readable manner, which is especially beneficial in competitive programming scenarios.

### 2. Parallel Loops with `std::for_each` and `std::execution::par`

C++20 enables parallelism in standard algorithms with `std::execution`. Using parallel execution policies, you can distribute loop iterations across multiple threads, which can drastically reduce the execution time for computationally expensive loops. This is especially useful when working with large datasets in competitive programming.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <execution>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec(1000000, 1);

    std::for_each(std::execution::par, vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int& elem) {
        elem *= 2;
    });

    return 0;
}
```

**Benefits**:

Parallel loops offer high performance, particularly when dealing with large input sizes that involve intensive computation. By utilizing multiple CPU cores, they significantly reduce execution time and handle heavy workloads more efficiently.

What makes this approach even more practical is that it requires minimal changes to existing code. The parallel execution is enabled simply by adding the execution policy `std::execution::par`, allowing traditional loops to run in parallel without requiring complex modifications.

**Considerations for competitive programmings**:

Parallel loops are highly effective for processing large datasets, making them ideal in competitive programming scenarios where massive inputs need to be handled efficiently. They can dramatically reduce execution time by distributing the workload across multiple threads.

However, they are less suitable for small inputs. In such cases, the overhead associated with managing threads may outweigh the performance gains, leading to slower execution compared to traditional loops.

## 3. `constexpr` Loops

With C++20, `constexpr` has been extended to allow more complex loops and logic at compile time. While this can lead to ultra-efficient code where calculations are precomputed during compilation, this technique has limited utility in competitive programming, where dynamic inputs are a central aspect of the problem. Since competitive programming requires handling varying inputs provided at runtime, `constexpr` loops are generally less useful in this context.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

constexpr std::array<int, 5> generate_squares() {
    std::array<int, 5> arr{};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        arr[i] = i * i;
    }
    return arr;
}

int main() {
    constexpr auto arr = generate_squares();
    for (int i : arr) {
        std::cout << i << " ";  // 0 1 4 9 16
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Benefits**:

Compile-time efficiency allows for faster runtime performance, as all necessary computations are completed during the compilation phase. This eliminates the need for processing during execution, leading to quicker program runs.

This approach is ideal for constant, static data. When all relevant data is known ahead of time, compile-time computation removes the need for runtime processing, providing a significant performance boost by bypassing real-time calculations.

### Considerations for competitive programmings

While constexpr loops are not suitable for processing dynamic inputs directly, they can be strategically used to create lookup tables or pre-compute values that are then utilized during runtime calculations. This can be particularly useful in problems involving mathematical sequences, combinatorics, or other scenarios where certain calculations can be predetermined. _However, it's important to balance the use of pre-computed data with memory constraints, as large lookup tables might exceed memory limits in some competitive programming environments_.

## 4. Early Exit Loops

In competitive programming, optimizing loops to exit early when a condition is met can drastically reduce execution time. This approach is especially useful when the solution does not require processing the entire input if an early condition is satisfied.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Early exit if a condition is met
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        if (vec[i] == 3) break;
        std::cout << vec[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Benefits**:

Early exit loops improve efficiency by terminating as soon as a specified condition is met, thus avoiding unnecessary iterations. This approach helps save time, especially when the loop would otherwise continue without contributing to the result.

This technique is particularly useful in search problems. By exiting the loop early when a target value is found, it can significantly enhance performance, reducing the overall execution time.

### Considerations for competitive programmings

Early exit loops are highly practical, as they allow a solution to be reached without the need to examine all the data. By cutting down unnecessary iterations, they help reduce execution time, making them particularly useful in scenarios where a result can be determined quickly based on partial input.

## 5. Indexed Loops with Range-Based `for`

While C++ offers powerful range-based `for` loops, there are scenarios where accessing elements by index is essential, especially when the loop logic requires modifying the index or accessing adjacent elements. Range-based `for` loops cannot directly access the index, so indexed loops remain valuable for such cases.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << vec[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Benefits**:

Indexed loops offer precise control by providing direct access to elements through their index, giving you full control over how the index changes during iteration. This level of control is crucial when fine-tuning the behavior of the loop.

They are essential when modifying iteration behavior, especially in cases where you need to adjust the index dynamically. This is useful for tasks such as skipping elements or implementing non-linear iteration patterns, allowing for flexible loop management.

**Considerations for competitive programmings**:

Indexed loops are well-suited for dynamic access, offering the flexibility required for more complex iteration logic. This makes them ideal for scenarios where direct control over the loop's behavior is necessary.

However, they are less expressive compared to range-based loops. While they provide detailed control, they tend to be more verbose and less concise than the streamlined syntax offered by range-based alternatives.

## 6. Standard Library Algorithms (`std::for_each`, `std::transform`)

Using standard library algorithms like `std::for_each` and `std::transform` allows for highly optimized iteration and transformation of container elements. These algorithms are highly optimized, making them ideal for competitive programming scenarios where efficiency is crucial.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    std::for_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int& x) { x *= 2; });

    for (const int& x : vec) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Benefits**:

Standard library algorithms are highly optimized for performance, often surpassing the efficiency of manually written loops. Their internal optimizations make them a powerful tool for handling operations in a time-efficient manner.

Additionally, these functions are concise and clear, providing a clean and expressive syntax to apply operations on containers. This simplicity enhances code readability while maintaining high performance, making them ideal for competitive programming.

### Considerations for competitive programmings

Standard library algorithms are great for transformation tasks, allowing you to apply operations on container elements with minimal code. They maximize efficiency while keeping the implementation simple and concise, making them particularly effective for handling transformations in competitive programming scenarios.
