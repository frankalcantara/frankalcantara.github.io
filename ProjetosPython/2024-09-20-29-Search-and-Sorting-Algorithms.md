# Search and Sorting Algorithms

## Binary Search

Problems that require efficient lookup in a sorted array or determining a condition within a range can be solved using binary search with time complexity $O(\log n)$.

## Sorting

Sorting problems involve ordering data to simplify subsequent tasks. Efficient sorting algorithms, such as mergesort or quicksort, run in $O(n \log n)$ time and are frequently needed as a preprocessing step for more complex algorithms.
