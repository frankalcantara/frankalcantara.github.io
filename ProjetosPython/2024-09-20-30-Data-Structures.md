# Data Structures

## Stacks and Queues

Problems involving stack-based or queue-based flows, where order of insertion and removal (FIFO/LIFO) is critical, appear often.

## Trees

Binary trees, AVL trees, or binary search trees (BSTs) are used in problems requiring fast insertions, deletions, and lookups. Segment trees or Fenwick trees (binary indexed trees) are commonly used for range query problems.

## Priority Queues (Heaps)

Heaps are employed in problems like scheduling, dynamic sorting, or pathfinding (Dijkstra’s algorithm) to maintain a dynamic set of elements where the highest (or lowest) priority element can be accessed quickly.

## Hashing

Hash maps (or dictionaries) are essential in problems requiring constant time lookups for checking membership or counting frequencies of elements.
