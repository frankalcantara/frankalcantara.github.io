# 7. Number Theory and Modular Arithmetic

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Efficiently find all prime numbers up to a certain limit in $O(n \log \log n)$ time.

- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Solves Diophantine equations and finds modular inverses, commonly used in cryptography and problems requiring modular arithmetic.

- **Modular Exponentiation**: Used in problems requiring efficient exponentiation of large numbers modulo a given integer.
