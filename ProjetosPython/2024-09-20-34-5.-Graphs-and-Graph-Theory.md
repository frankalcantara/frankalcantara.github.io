# 5. Graphs and Graph Theory

- **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Basic graph traversal algorithms, often used to explore nodes or determine connectivity in graphs.

- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Problems where the goal is to find a subset of the edges that connects all vertices in a weighted graph while minimizing the total edge weight (Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms).

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Algorithms such as Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall are used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

- **Maximum Flow**: Problems involving optimizing flow through a network, such as Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp algorithms.

- **Strongly Connected Components**: Identifying maximal strongly connected subgraphs in directed graphs using algorithms like Kosaraju or Tarjan’s.
